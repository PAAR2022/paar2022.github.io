## Submission

 Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15 pages) [via EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=paar2022). Those limits are references excluded. Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will select a balanced program of high-quality contributions. Short submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop are particularly welcome.

Submissions should be in PDF. Final versions should be prepared in LaTeX using the ["easychair.cls" class file](https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors). Paper need to be submitted through the EasyChair page. PAAR proceedings will be published electronically as CEUR workshop proceedings. 

Call for Papers: Available on [EasyChair Smart CFP](https://easychair.org/cfp/PAAR2022) or as [Plantext file](cfp-paar2022.txt).

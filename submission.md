## Submission

 Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15 pages) via EasyChair. Those limits are references excluded. Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will select a balanced program of high-quality contributions. Short submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop are particularly welcome.

Submissions should be in PDF. Final versions should be prepared in LaTeX using the "easychair.cls" class file. Paper should be submitted through the EasyChair page. PAAR proceedings will be published electronically in the CEUR workshop proceedings.

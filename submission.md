## Submission

 Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15 pages) [via EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=paar2022). Those limits are references excluded. Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will select a balanced program of high-quality contributions. Short submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop are particularly welcome.

Talk: Training ENIGMAs, CoPs, and other thinking creatures

Abstract: The talk will mainly discuss several recent AI/TP systems and
experiments that combine reasoning with learning in positive feedback
loops. I will try to describe the settings, the datasets that may
today contain millions of proofs, the interesting parts of the
algorithms, and some of the practical challenges when building
learning-guided systems that actually prove theorems in real
time. Time permitting, I will also discuss the outlook, interesting
future directions and initial experiments related to them.

### Geoff Sutcliffe (University of Miami, USA)

Talk: The Logic Languages of the TPTP World

Abstract: The TPTP World is a well established infrastructure that supports research, development, and deployment of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems. This talk provides an overview of the logic languages of the TPTP World, from classical first-order form, through typed first-order form, up to typed higher-order form, and beyond to non-classical forms. The logic languages are described in a non-technical way, and are illustrated with examples using the TPTP language.

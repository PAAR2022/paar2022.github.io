******************************************************************************


The automation of logical reasoning is a challenge that has been
studied intensively in fields including mathematics, philosophy, and
computer science. PAAR is the workshop on turning this theory into
practice: how can automated reasoning tools be built that work and are
useful in applications? PAAR covers all aspects of this challenge:
which theories, logics, or fragments are well-behaved in practice, and
connect well to application domains? which reasoning tasks are
tractable and useful? which algorithms are able to solve real-world
instances? how should automated reasoning tools be designed,
implemented, tested, and evaluated?

The goal of PAAR is to bring together theoreticians, tool developers,
and users, to concentrate on the practical aspects of automated
reasoning. The workshop welcomes high-quality contributions of any
kind, including new research results, presentation of work in
progress, presentation of new tools, new implementation techniques,
new application domains, or case studies.

PAAR 2022 will host the meeting of the working group on Automated
Theorem Provers of the EuroProofNet COST action 
(https://europroofnet.github.io/). Every workshop participant is 
welcome to attend.

Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either an
extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15 pages), excluding
references, via EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=paar2022.
Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will select a balanced 
program of high-quality contributions. Short submissions that could stimulate 
fruitful discussion at the workshop are particularly welcome.

Submissions should be prepared in LaTeX using the EasyChair proceedings style. 
The package containing the class file and its user guide and some helper tools 
can be downloaded from http://www.easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip.

Topics include, but are not limited to:
--------------------------------------
* automated reasoning in propositional, first-order, higher-order, and
  non-classical logics;
* implementation of provers (SAT, SMT, resolution, superposition, tableau,
   instantiation-based, rewriting, logical frameworks, etc.);
* automated reasoning tools for all kinds of practical problems and
  applications;
* pragmatics of automated reasoning within proof assistants;
* practical experiences, usability aspects, feasibility studies;
* evaluation of implementation techniques and automated reasoning tools;
* performance aspects, benchmarking approaches; non-standard approaches to
  automated reasoning, non-standard forms of automated reasoning, new
  applications;
* implementation techniques, optimisation techniques, machine learning,
  strategies and heuristics, fairness;
* tools or methods that support prover development;
* system descriptions and demos.
